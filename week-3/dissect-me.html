      How does git help you keep track of changes?
      Let's begin with git because this file management system works at the local level, and in some ways it is the precursor to GitHub. An essential tool within git is the branch feature. Branches allow us to create files temporarily in the directory we are working in. We can then experiment with the changes that we have made and only when we are happy with the end result of our code to we add new files or edits to our permanent directory. The commands for git are very simple and they allow you to quickly incorporate your temporary files as well as leave descriptive comments to help you document modifications. We use git to apply a careful and calculated approach to coding.
