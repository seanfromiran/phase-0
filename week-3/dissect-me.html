      <h2>Does git help?</h2>
      How does git help you keep track of changes?
      Let's begin with git because this file management system works at the local level, and in some ways it is the precursor to GitHub. An essential tool within git is the branch feature. Branches allow us to create files temporarily in the directory we are working in. We can then experiment with the changes that we have made and only when we are happy with the end result of our code to we add new files or edits to our permanent directory. The commands for git are very simple and they allow you to quickly incorporate your temporary files as well as leave descriptive comments to help you document modifications. We use git to apply a careful and calculated approach to coding.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

We used the tags <html>,<body>,<title>,<head>,<meta>,<h2>, and <article>. This challenge gave us a pretty good idea of what tags we will continue to use from the new snippet that we created. All the tags that we have in this new file are essential to the creation of a new html file because they provide us our general structure.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are laid out from the outside in. This means that at the most basic level, we have the entirety of our code (except the DOCTYPE) between two <html> tags. This is important because everything is now defined as html code. Another way this system is applied is through the <body> tag, everything contained here is going to be on the webpage itself, and we can further define our <body> element with more tags within it that will further divide our page into meaningful sections. The browser applies this "outside-in" system in order to process and display the tags of our html file.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I had no idea about tab triggers so that was a nice little revelation! I could definitely see myself using snippets to help me code more quickly, especially when things get more complicated and we begin to use more languages. Researchng shortcuts is very important and I have already begun to do so (I know it is a big part of what makes Sublime special). One of my favorite shortcuts is ctrl+h because it allows me to find and change my files very easily and on a macro level.
