# These links were very informative and I learned about starting small and counter-intuitive productivity techniques. Time Boxing is a technique that defines a pre-defined chunk of time for a specific task, such as the Pomodoro Technique.

Currently, I manage my time by thinking about how long I think a task will take, and then I set aside a certain number of hours to do the task. I am pretty used to working under deadlines, so I feel like this really motivates me to start working hard. However, I definitely feel that I could change my productivity practices. I usually create a lot of anxiety in myself and I feel stressed while I work. I plan to employ the techniques for developing good habits by starting small. There are a few things I would like to improve about myself and the gradual method seems like it would work well for me. 

My plan for Phase 0 time management is to try and do everything on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so that I can work the rest of the days of the week.  This is going to involve some planning and ideally I would like to space my workload evenly across the three days, so I am not too overwhelmed. Identifying what I need to do as early as possible will help me a lot in planning.

## 1. A shell is a command line interpreter. Bash is a shell that we use in Unix.

2. It was a bit challenging to stay interested in watching the video for this material, because I am already familiar with a lot of the ideas presented, but I wanted to pick up on things I didn't know.

3. Yes, I was able to succesfully use all of the commands.

4. I would say the commands that allow you to move between files and folders are the most important. This is because moving between files occurs very often and so when we simplify the process we greatly improve our workflow.

5. pwd: print working directory

ls: list directory

mv: move directory

cd: change directory

../: view root of current directory

touch: create new file

mkdir: make new directory

less: I forget!

rmdir: remove directory

rm: remove file

help: opens help manual
