Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

On your GitHub profile page, first click the "+" sign in the top right corner then select "New repository". Next, enter your Repository name in the required field, and decide if you want to initialize the repository with a README (informative document attached to your code), if you would like to add a license (if you want to use open source), and finally press the "Create repository" button at the bottom. 

To clone the repository, copy the link on the right side of the new repository page. Then, type "git clone URL_YOU_COPIED" into the command line, after you have changed into the directory you desire (use the cd command).

Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the code used for some application is viewable to everyone.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open Source is really cool because it removes a lot of the mystique surrounding programming. It allows others to build on established ideas and really helps the community continue to move forward. Yes, it feels like utopia!

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Using licenses is really important if you want to attach some sort of label to the code that you are writing (especially open source). This ensures that you don't get into any trouble legally, and also that others are not just outright stealing your ideas.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The concepts of changing between branches and push/pull requests were really solidifed here. I struggled a bit with maintaining my files and keeping relaxed when I ran into problems.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

No, the resources provided were enough for me to understand the material.
