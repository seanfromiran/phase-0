What is a wireframe?

A wireframe acts like the foundation level for your websites layout.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

This tool allows developers to visualize their site even before coding has begun. Wireframing is an important concept to understand because it lets programmers establsih the flow between web pages.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Yea, it was a fun process because it really made me think about how web pages need to relate to one another. Also, doing it by hand was a pretty cool arts and crafts project!

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

After doing research within the links provided for this assignment, I just went straight ahead and drew out my first idea because it seemed logical and function. For my first wireframing I didn't want to overthink it.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

The examples and templates provided on webdesign.tutsplus.com gave me a lot of ideas and they allowed me to wireframe with confidence. I was mainly concerned with spacing and how things would scale across different platforms. I had a lot of questions related to the navbar and how I should position it, looking at example sites provided answers, though.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

Deciding what format I wanted to use was a bit tedious. I looked through a bunch of online options but didn't really want to deal with freeware that looked piecemeal, so I just did it by hand. Fortunately, this choice transitioned in to the fun part of the project, using pen and paper added a tactile element that was a nice break from the screen. A bigger website seems like it would be a lot of fun to wireframe by hand as well, and I plan on using this technique in Phase 1.
