<!-- 

- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I have built sites with HTML before so there honestly was not much of a translation for me. I will say though that it was nice to refresh my knowledge before this assignment, as I probably didn't have to look up as many things as I would have.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

It was really easy because w3schools.com is an excellent resource that allows developers to easily look up HTML5 elements. After doing the practice exercises and with my previous experience, it was straightforward to get through the assignment.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

It is difficult to not add formatting, but because this was our first pair programming assignment, it was best to keep it simple! Also, we always closed our tags and made sure that our indentation was appropraite for the code. We aren't experts yet but that doesn't mean we can't start developing good habits!

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML is pretty basic, this is bad because we have to rely on CSS for formatting which means more files to keep track of. However, the foundation for our web page is very solid and we create these movable building blocks when working with HTML.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I really like the w3schools resource as I said before. I feel like using this website, as well as copy-pasting old HTML files that I have made, allows me to get through HTML coding pretty easily (for now!).
